This is a prototype for an education app where students can organize their learning material as well as interacting with instructors and other students. The two main functions are communicating between students and assignment submitting.

Five new desirable functions are: 
    1. Course creation for everyone. Most education apps only allow instructors to create content. However, it is nice to have students creating their own course to share a perspective of students.
    2. Video bookmarks. It is nice to be able to organize important moments from the videos.
    3. Sharing moments of videos in a group chat.
    4. Creating a new course by taking many parts from many existing courses. 
    5. Allowing students to be TA.
